NWChemEx Base Repository
==============================

Building C++ projects is a laborious process that is somewhat simplified with
CMake.  Nonetheless CMake still requires quite a bit of hand tuning and has
quite a learning curve.  NWChemExBase is designed to provide a reusable CMake 
setup for C++ projects that is easy to setup, flexible enough to handle 
the dynamic nature of most builds, and robust across multiple platforms.

Topics
------

### User-centric

The following are topics that may be of interest to users building projects 
that currently rely on NWChemExBase or developers of projects wanting to 
leverage NWChemExBase for their projects.  

- [Building a Project that Uses NWChemExBase](dox/Building.md)
- [Using NWChemExBase in Your Project](dox/QuickStart.md)
  - [Current List of Supported Dependencies](dox/SupportedDependencies.md)
  - [BLAS and LAPACK](dox/SoYouWannaFindBLAS.md)

### Developer-centric

At the moment most developer notes are contained in the following page or 
scattered around the various files in comments.  It is my goal to migrate 
much of the comments into a developer manual and to break the following 
monolithic document up.

- [Extending NWChemExBase](dox/ExtendingNWChemExBase.md)

Contributing

statement regarding what that all entails...

This entire repository will be licensed at some point.

Acknowledgements
